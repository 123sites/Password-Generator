# ⭐ Random-Password-Generator ⭐

## Description ✏️

This was a challenge where I had to create an application that randomly created a password based on the given criteria.  It runs in the browser. I updated this by using JavaScript.  In addition, this application shows well on a laptop and a cell phone (see below images).

The password generated:
1) Is 8-128 characters long.
2) Confirms whether or not they want to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.
3) The input is validated on the Console and has at least 1 character type selected.
4) Afterwards, the password is displayed and written onto the webpage.
